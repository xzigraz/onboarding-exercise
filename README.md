# Onboarding Exercise
Create an onboading experience that separate into different steps:
1. Collect driver info
	- First Name
	- Last Name
	- Address
2. Collect car info
	- Year
	- Brand
	- Model

and so on.

Since it's a prototype, we don't have a have all the pages build out, but we do want to show:
- How progress bar works
- How form fields work
- How the navigation of the forms work
- Add and removing of the cars
